# Security Guidelines

## 🔒 Credential Security

### ✅ Current Security Measures

1. **Environment Variables**: All sensitive credentials are stored in `.env` file
2. **Git Exclusion**: `.env` file is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
3. **Server-side Only**: Credentials are imported using `$env/static/private` (never sent to client)
4. **Access Token Caching**: Mpesa access tokens are cached securely in memory with expiration
5. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
6. **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are protected against abuse (3 requests per 5 minutes)
7. **Security Headers**: HTTP security headers are set to prevent common attacks

### 🛡️ Production Security Checklist

- [ ] **Change default admin password** from `admin123`
- [ ] **Use HTTPS** in production (required for secure cookies)
- [ ] **Set secure environment variables** on production server
- [ ] **Enable database encryption** if storing sensitive data
- [ ] **Implement proper logging** and monitoring
- [ ] **Regular security updates** for dependencies
- [ ] **Use production Mpesa credentials** (not sandbox)
- [ ] **Implement CSRF protection** for forms
- [ ] **Add request signing** for webhook verification

### 🚨 Security Vulnerabilities to Monitor

1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Run `npm audit` regularly
2. **Exposed Credentials**: Never commit `.env` files
3. **SQL Injection**: Use prepared statements (already implemented)
4. **XSS Attacks**: Sanitize all user inputs (implemented)
5. **CSRF Attacks**: Implement CSRF tokens for forms
6. **Rate Limiting**: Monitor for abuse patterns

### 📋 Environment Variables Security

**Required Variables:**
```bash
MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY=your_actual_key
MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_actual_secret
MPESA_BUSINESS_SHORTCODE=your_shortcode
MPESA_PASSKEY=your_passkey
MPESA_CALLBACK_URL=https://yourdomain.com/api/mpesa/callback
ADMIN_PASSWORD=strong_password_here
```

**Security Rules:**
- Never use default/placeholder values in production
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Monitor access logs for suspicious activity

### 🔐 Database Security

- Database file is excluded from git (`.gitignore`)
- Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Sensitive data (phone numbers) should be encrypted in production
- Regular backups with encryption

### 🌐 Network Security

- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Validate all webhook signatures
- Use secure headers (implemented)

### 📊 Monitoring & Logging

**Recommended Monitoring:**
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual donation patterns
- API rate limit violations
- Database access patterns
- Error rates and types

**Log Security Events:**
- Admin login attempts
- Failed payment attempts
- Webhook callback failures
- Rate limit violations

### 🚀 Deployment Security

**Production Deployment:**
1. Use environment variables (not `.env` files)
2. Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
3. Use a reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
4. Implement proper firewall rules
5. Regular security updates
6. Database backups and encryption
7. Monitor logs and set up alerts

### 📞 Incident Response

**If credentials are compromised:**
1. Immediately rotate all affected credentials
2. Check logs for unauthorized access
3. Notify Safaricom if Mpesa credentials are compromised
4. Review and update security measures
5. Monitor for fraudulent transactions

### 🔍 Security Testing

**Regular Security Checks:**
- Run `npm audit` for dependency vulnerabilities
- Test rate limiting functionality
- Verify input validation
- Check for exposed sensitive data
- Test authentication mechanisms
